# Hot Air - an experimental story by Pete and ChatGPT

## Minimal promptcraft, exercising some of ChatGPT's creative writing skills

This is an emergent story of four people - Franklin, Anika, Liliane, and Mateo - and the transformative power of friendship. The friends meet and have adventures in different places around the world, sharing experiences and creative endeavors, forming a deep and lasting bond.

It was written by ChatGPT (GPT-4 model, [Mar 23 Version](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes)) in April 2023, with prompts by [Peter Kaminski](http://peterkaminski.wiki/). There are about 10,000 words in the story. It is shared under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

On this page, there is commentary by me (Pete), and links, which are the prompts I gave to ChatGPT. The links go to a page with ChatGPT's response. (Or if you like, you can view [[Hot Air - All Chapters|all chapters on one page]].)

I wrote everything on this page, and the italicized prompts which are repeated on each chapter page, but ChatGPT wrote all the chapters. Afterwards, I wrote the titles and added the chapter/response numbers, and created this website.

I didn't mean for this to turn into a story, really; in my mind it was more like those old "choose your adventure" branching stories that had a choice to follow one branch or another at the end of each chapter. Except in this case, ChatGPT wrote each next chapter de novo.

Considering "Hot Air" as a story, while it does progress, it is not particularly well constructed or artfully written. That's because the story arc evolved from simple choices and paths I took, response by response. It is more of an experiment in driving ChatGPT in creative writing, rather than an attempt to write a real story. If ChatGPT and I tried to write a real story or novel, we might be able to do a better job.

I was impressed by ChatGPT's attention to detail, continuing to keep track of the people, their interests, and the events in the story

Overall, I find that ChatGPT doesn't write or create structure as well as the *best* human writers; but it's much better than bad writers, and as good as many. ChatGPT is also effortlessly creative, which I always find startling.

The story begins with an open-ended prompt:

> [[1. Franklin and Anika meet in Albuquerque|1. Choose an annual event and a location, and describe an unlikely friendship that develops between two people who meet there.]]

The AI created Franklin and Anika, at the International Hot Air Balloon Fiesta.  With the next prompt, I intended for the AI to describe another adventure for Franklin and Anika, but I wasn't specific enough...

> [[2. Liliane and Mateo meet in Montreux|2. How about the next year at the festival in Montreux?]]

... so the AI created Liliane and Mateo. I continue prompting for more adventures:

> [[3. Franklin and Anika meet again in Albuquerque|3. Describe Franklin and Anika's meeting a year later.]]

> [[4. The four friends meet for the first time in Melbourne|4. Choose an annual event and a location, and tell me about Franklin, Anika, Liliane, and Mateo all meeting each other and hitting it off.]]

Maybe we should visit a couple of the friends' homes?

> [[5. The friends visit Anika's family home|5. When the four next meet, it is at Anika's parents' house. Describe what happens.]]

> [[6. The friends visit Mateo's family home|6. Describe their next meeting, at Mateo's home.]]

Back to a shared adventure; this time the AI picks Kyoto:

> [[7. Kyoto - a journey of cultural immersion|7. Describe a trip all four friends go on together.]]

We need a little conflict, I ask for a misadventure. And, let's create a partner for Liliane:

> [[8. The friends get lost in Paris|8. Describe a misadventure the four get into when they meet at Liliane's home with her wife.]]

Instead of adventures, how about describing different ways the friends might communicate?

> [[9. A letter from Franklin to Mateo|9. Write a letter from Franklin to Mateo.]]

> [[10. An email from Anika to Liliane|10. Write an email from on of the friends to another.]]

> [[11. Group chat - let's go to New Zealand!|11. Now create a group message thread between all four.]]

> [[12. Video call - planning the New Zealand trip|12. Describe the video call.]]

Now, follow on from the video call planning a trip. Try to shift the point of view from the friends, to other people meeting the friends.

> [[13. People we meet in New Zealand|13. Describe the New Zealand trip through the eyes of the people who the friends meet.]]

Meta: I didn't remember whose homes we've visited and whose we haven't; turns out ChatGPT didn't really either:

> [[14. Which friend's home have we not visited yet?|14. Which friend's home have we not visited yet?]]

> [[15. We visited Mateo's home, didn't we?|15. We visited Mateo's home, didn't we?]]

Since we left out Franklin, let's visit his home:

> [[16. Franklin's town - and personal history|16. Describe the friends trips and then their visit to Franklin's home, where learn about some of the formative experiences from Franklin's life.]]

Okay, we have enough to sort of structure a story - let's have the AI take a turn at writing prompts now:

> [[17. Ten suggested prompts|17. Consider your previous responses as the beginning of a narrative arc. What would be some good prompts to continue the development of the narrative?]]

Go on to ask the AI to use the prompts it came up with. (titles by me)

> [[18. Journeys of the heart - celebrating friendship and travel|18. Continue with prompt number 1.]] (Journeys of the heart - celebrating friendship and travel)

> [[19. "Journeys of the Heart" was in New York City|19. Which city was the gallery in?]] ("Journeys of the Heart" was in New York City)

> [[20. Lost in Patagonia - a journey of challenge and friendship|20. Continue with prompt number 2.]] (Lost in Patagonia - a journey of challenge and friendship)

> [[21. Dream retreat in southern France|21. Continue with prompt number 3.]] (Dream retreat in southern France)

> [[22. Through thick and thin - the friends' unbreakable bond|22. Continue with prompt number 4.]] (Through thick and thin - the friends' unbreakable bond)

> [[23. Adapting to the changing landscape of our lives|23. Continue with prompt number 5.]] (Adapting to the changing landscape of our lives)

> [[24. The Friendship Chronicles|24. Continue with prompt number 6.]] (The Friendship Chronicles)

> [[25. Revisiting our journeys with children and grandchildren|25. continue with prompt 7.]] (Revisiting our journeys with children and grandchildren)

> [[26. A museum dedicated to the exploration of human connection, friendship, and creativity|26. continue with prompt 8.]] (A museum dedicated to the exploration of human connection, friendship, and creativity)

> [[27. The Infinite Bond - A Lifetime of Friendship and Adventure|27. continue with prompt 9.]] (The Infinite Bond - A Lifetime of Friendship and Adventure)

> [[28. The friends' love and legacy shine on|28. continue with prompt 10.]] (The friends' love and legacy shine on)

Okay, let's start to wrap this up - can the AI make some titles?

> [[29. Create titles for each of your responses.|29. Create titles for each of your responses.]]

The titles are good, but it doesn't remember all of its responses, so ultimately I wrote all the titles.

As an experiment, let's try to level up the story-telling a little:

> [[30. Art gallery - show, not tell|30. Retell the visit to the art gallery, but use dialogue and settings to "show, not tell"]]

It does a decent job with some dialogue, although this doesn't seem to be a retelling of a previous chapter, but rather a new chapter.

And there you have it - an experiment with AI-generated hot air.
