_Write a letter from Franklin to Mateo._

Dear Mateo,

I hope this letter finds you in good spirits and enjoying life to the fullest. It's been a few months since our last reunion in Paris at Liliane's home, and I can't help but reminisce about the incredible experiences we've shared over the years. From our first meeting in Albuquerque to our adventures in Melbourne, Mumbai, Buenos Aires, Kyoto, and finally, the beautiful streets of Paris, it's been an incredible journey.

I've been thinking about the misadventure we got into with Liliane, Anika, and Camille that rainy afternoon in Paris, and I can't help but smile. Despite getting lost and drenched in the downpour, we found our way to that charming little café, where we shared laughter and warmth over café au lait and croissants. It's moments like these that remind me of the true essence of our friendship—our ability to embrace the unexpected, to find joy in the simple things, and to support one another through thick and thin.

Lately, I've been working on a photography project inspired by our travels, capturing the essence of the places we've visited and the connections we've made. I'm particularly fond of the photos from our hot air balloon rides and the serene landscapes of Kyoto. I would love to hear about any new musical projects you've been working on, especially those inspired by our trips. Your ability to blend traditional and modern sounds never ceases to amaze me.

I was talking to Anika and Liliane the other day, and we all agreed that it's about time for another reunion. What do you think about choosing a new destination and exploring yet another fascinating corner of the world together? I'm sure there are countless adventures awaiting us, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for our incredible group of friends.

Please give my warmest regards to your family, and I hope we can catch up soon, either over a video call or, better yet, in person.

Take care, my friend, and never lose your sense of wonder and curiosity. I'm grateful for our friendship and the memories we've created together. Until we meet again, may your days be filled with happiness, creativity, and a healthy dose of adventure.

Best regards,

Franklin
