Subject: Long Time, No See! Let's Catch Up!

Hey Anika,

How have you been? It feels like ages since we were all together in Paris, exploring the city on bicycles and laughing our way through that unexpected rainstorm. I hope everything's going well for you, and your travel blog is thriving as ever. Your passion for sharing your adventures and the stories of the people you meet along the way is truly inspiring.

I just got off the phone with Franklin, and he mentioned he's working on a photography project inspired by our travels. That got me thinking about our unforgettable experiences and the strong bond we've formed over the years. It's incredible how much we've grown and learned from one another through our cultural exchanges and shared adventures.

Speaking of growth, I recently attended a workshop on traditional Japanese pottery, and it reminded me of our time in Kyoto. The delicate artistry and the calming, meditative process of shaping clay brought back fond memories of our trip. I even managed to create a small tea bowl as a souvenir, although it's far from perfect!

Since it's been a while since our last reunion, I was wondering if you're up for another adventure with the gang? I know we're all eager to catch up and continue exploring new places and cultures. Perhaps you could suggest a destination from your travels that you'd love to share with us. I'm excited just thinking about the possibilities!

Please let me know when you're free for a video call, so we can catch up properly and start planning our next reunion. It's always a pleasure to hear about your experiences and insights, and I can't wait to see where our friendship takes us next.

Take care, and I hope to hear from you soon!

Warmest regards,

Liliane
